query_writer_instructions = """Your goal is to generate sophisticated and diverse web search queries. These queries are intended for an advanced automated web research tool capable of analyzing complex results, following links, and synthesizing information.

Previous Conversation Context:
{conversation_history}

Instructions:
- Always prefer a single search query, only add another query if the original question requests multiple aspects or elements and one query is not enough.
- Each query should focus on one specific aspect of the original question.
- Don't produce more than {number_queries} queries.
- Queries should be diverse, if the topic is broad, generate more than 1 query.
- Don't generate multiple similar queries, 1 is enough.
- Query should ensure that the most current information is gathered. The current date is {current_date}.
- Consider the conversation context and previous questions to generate more relevant and targeted queries.

Format: 
- Format your response as a JSON object with ALL two of these exact keys:
   - "rationale": Brief explanation of why these queries are relevant
   - "query": A list of search queries

Example:

Topic: What revenue grew more last year apple stock or the number of people buying an iphone
```json
{{
    "rationale": "To answer this comparative growth question accurately, we need specific data points on Apple's stock performance and iPhone sales metrics.

knowledge_query_writer_instructions = """Your goal is to generate sophisticated and search-optimized queries for Channel Talk's internal knowledge base. Create standalone queries that can effectively retrieve relevant documentation, guides, and service information.

Previous Conversation Context:
{conversation_history}

Query Strategy Instructions:
1. **Standalone Queries**: Each query must be self-contained and understandable without context
2. **Query Decomposition**: If the question has multiple intents or aspects, break it down into separate focused queries
3. **Query Expansion**: If the query is too specific or abstract, expand it to include related terms and synonyms
4. **Maximum 3 Queries**: Generate 1-3 queries based on complexity and scope
5. **Context Awareness**: Consider the conversation history to understand ongoing topics and generate more relevant queries

Query Optimization Guidelines:
- Include both Korean and English terms when relevant
- Add synonyms and related concepts for better coverage
- Focus on actionable keywords (설정, 사용법, 기능, 차이점, 방법, etc.)
- Consider different user intents (how-to, troubleshooting, comparison, configuration)
- Reference previous questions or topics discussed to provide continuity

Query Selection Rules:
- 1 Query: For simple, focused questions with single intent
- 2-3 Queries: For complex questions with multiple aspects or when expansion is needed
- Never generate duplicate or highly similar queries
- Prioritize diverse search angles over query count

Format: 
- Format your response as a JSON object with these exact keys:
   - "rationale": Explain your query strategy and why these queries optimize Channel Talk knowledge search
   - "query": Array of 1-3 search-optimized queries

Examples:

Topic: 채널톡에서 유저챗과 그룹챗의 차이점이 뭔가요?
```json

    "query": ["유저챗 그룹챗 기능 차이점 비교", "개인상담 그룹상담 사용 시나리오 활용법", "1:1채팅 그룹채팅 설정 관리 방법"]

Previous Conversation Context:
{conversation_history}

**Your Task:**
Analyze the user's query to determine if it's clear enough to provide a meaningful answer, or if it requires clarification questions to understand the user's specific intent. Consider the conversation history to understand the context and ongoing discussion.

**Clarification Needed When:**
1. **Too Abstract/General**: Question is overly broad or vague
   - Example: "이거 어떻게 해요?" (How do I do this?)
   - Example: "좋은 방법 알려주세요" (Tell me a good method)

2. **Multiple Interpretations**: Query can be understood in several different ways
   - Example: "채널톡에서 메시지가 안 와요" (Messages aren't coming in Channel Talk - could be receiving, sending, notifications, etc.)

3. **Missing Context**: Lacks necessary background information or specific situation details
   - Example: "오류가 나는데 도와주세요" (I'm getting an error, please help - no error details)

4. **Unclear Target**: Uncertain about what specifically the user wants to know
   - Example: "이거 되나요?" (Does this work? - unclear what 'this' refers to)

**Clarification Guidelines:**
1. **Acknowledge Understanding**: Show you understand the general intent
2. **Identify Specific Ambiguity**: Explain what needs clarification
3. **Provide Options/Examples**: Offer specific choices or concrete examples
4. **Limit Questions**: Ask 2-3 focused questions maximum
5. **Make Answering Easy**: Structure questions for simple responses

**Response Format:**
Respond in JSON format with these exact keys:
